To run Flutter through the command line:

We have a IP error situation.
So I make the change accordng to my IP so you need to change that as well.
Its on the flutter file in the main.dart.
You need to change IP to your one.
Besides I also add the solution and which site I found it.
Solution: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73030822/flutter-error-connection-refused-os-error-connection-refused-errno-111-a"
In Mac, you can use localhost or 127.0.0.1
This problem only occurs in Windows with Android Studio.
Windows or Android Studio does not allow you to choose localhost as your API since it finds it insecure.
That's why we had to use our LAN address (Our IP address in our local area network).

AYBERK GAYY!!!!!!!
